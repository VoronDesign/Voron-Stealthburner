### A note about Rapido orientations

Depending on where the Rapido is sourced, it may come in one of two _unsupported_ heatsink orientations.

To change the orientation of heatsink to a supported orientation:

1. Loosen the grub screw on the side.
2. Remove the 3 screws around the heater core.
3. Rotate the heatsink +/- 120Â° into the correct orientation (see the pictures below).
4. Install and _gently tighten_ the 3 screws around the heater core.
5. _Gently tighten_ the side grub screw.
6. **Be careful not to over-tighten any screws when reassembling.**  Over-tightening can cause the heatbreak to bend and potentially restrict the filament path. Checking for smooth filament movement through a cold hotend without a nozzle is recommended prior to reinstalling the Rapido into the printhead.
